The Source Code Finder (SCF) searches through ABAP  source code in Methods, Enhancement Implementations, DTPs, and Transformations. You can enter a pattern you want to search.

The pattern can either be a word e.g. customer, or you can add the asterisk (\*) to search for all cu\* combinations.

Under last_build you find a standalone version of the tool which can be imported by copy and paste. This file is always overwritten when new development will be done. If you want to contribute, make a pull request for the repository and make your changes.
